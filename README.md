# UnfuckAssemblyLoader

This should really be called Unfuck**Oxide**AssemblyLoader.  

This allows DLLs in the Rust `HarmonyMods` folder to be used as references ( `// Reference: xyz.dll` ) in Oxide plugins. Without the ability to do this, it becomes very difficult to create combined Oxide and Harmony workflows.
